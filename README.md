WorldGuard lets you and players guard areas of land against griefers and undesirables, as well as tweak and disable various gameplay features of Minecraft.

* Block creeper and wither block damage, falling damage, etc.;
* Disable fire spread, lava fire spread, ice formation, Endermen picking up blocks, etc.;
* Blacklist certain items and blocks so they can't be used;
* Warn moderators when certain items and blocks are used;
* Protect areas of your world so only certain people can build in them;
* Set areas where PVP, TNT, mob damage, and other features are disabled;
* Protect your server from various 'exploits' like magical obsidian creation machines;
* Disable, or enable, various Minecraft features, like sponges from classic;
* Add useful commands like an immediate "STOP ALL FIRE SPREAD" command.
* Enable only features you want! Everything is off by default.
